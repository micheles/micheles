Hello, chromatic!

Last year we exchanged a few emails and OnLamp published my paper on
GraphViz and dot (http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/05/06/graphviz_dot.html). 

Since then, I wanted to write something else, but I got involved in many 
other things and I could not find the time. However, it seems that
now I have some spare time, and also an interesting subject to write on:
automatic testing of Web applications.

I did some work on the subject, and I was very happy when, as an aftermath 
of the ACCU conference in Oxford, I discovered that there is already a 
nice little language written with the purpose of testing Web application, 
and actually two Python implementations of it: 
PBP, the Python Browser poseur (http://pbp.berlios.de) and twill 
(http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/twill/README.html). They are
based on the mechanize library by John J. Lee, which in turns
is inspired by a Perl package with the same name. 

I think these tools are pretty useful (they can test *any* web
application, not just Python-based applications) and not enough
well known, so I would like to popularize them. And what best of
an O'Reilly article? ;)

If you are interested, I can send you a draft in a few days.
Best,


         Michele Simionato
