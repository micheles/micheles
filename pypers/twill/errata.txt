I scanned the paper and found a few misprints. You should be able to do
the changes with a search and replace:


'the app calls'                ->  'the application calls'
'even if have used'            ->  'even if you have used'
'in order togenerate'          ->  'in order to generate'
'is not that difficilt'        ->  'is not that difficult'
'--. small languages'           ->  '-- small languages'
'convert it in a twill script'  ->  'convert it into a twill script'
'previous code had to fill it'  ->  'previously we had to fill it'
'sometimes don't need'          ->  'sometimes you don't need'
'at highest possible level'     ->  'at the highest possible level'

For the rest, it looks fine.
Cheers,
