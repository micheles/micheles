``super`` is Python a built-in, first introduced in Python 2.2 and
slightly improved and fixed in later versions, which is often
misunderstood by the average Python programmer. One of the reasons for
that, is the poor documentation of ``super``: at the time of this
writing (May 2008) the documentation is incomplete and in some parts
misleading and even wrong. For instance, the standard documentation
(even for the new 2.6 version
http://docs.python.org/dev/library/functions.html#super) still says::

  super(type[, object-or-type])
    Return the superclass of type. If the second argument is omitted the 
    super object returned is unbound. If the second argument is an object, 
    isinstance(obj, type) must be true. If the second argument is a type, 
    issubclass(type2, type) must be true. super() only works for new-style 
    classes.

The first sentence is just plain wrong: ``super`` does not return the 
superclass. There is no such a thing as "the" superclass in a Multiple 
Inheritance (MI) world. Also, the sentence about *unbound* is misleading,
since it may easily lead the programmer to think about bound and unbound
methods, whereas it has nothing to do with that concept. Finally, there are
subtle pitfalls and dark corners of ``super`` which are not at all mentioned. 
IMNSHO ``super`` is one of the most trickiest and surprising Python 
constructs, and we absolutely needs a document to shed light on its secrets. 
The present paper is a first step in this direction: it aims to tell you 
the *truth* about ``super``. At least the amount of truth
I have discovered with my experimentations, which is certainly
not the whole truth ;)

A fair warning is in order here: this document is aimed to expert 
Pythonistas. It assumes you are familiar with new-style classes [#]_
and the Method Resolution Order (MRO_) 
concept; moreover a good understanding of descriptors_ would be extremely 
useful in order to grasp this document. Some parts also require good 
familiarity with metaclasses_. All in all, this paper is not for the faint 
of heart ;)

First thing: there is no superclass in a MI world
----------------------------------------------------------

Readers familiar will single inheritance languages, such as
Java or Smalltalk, will have a clear concept of superclass
in mind. This concept, however, has *no useful meaning* in Python or in
other multiple inheritance languages. I became convinced of this fact
after a discussion with Bjorn Pettersen and Alex Martelli 
on comp.lang.python in May 2003 [#]_
(at that time I was mistakenly thinking that one could define a
superclass concept in Python). Consider this example from that
discussion:

 ::

            +-----+
            |  T  |
            |a = 0|
            +-----+
          /         \
         /           \
     +-------+    +-------+
     |   A   |    |   B   | 
     |       |    | a = 2 |
     +-------+    +-------+
         \           /
          \         /
            +-----+
            |  C  |
            +-----+
               :
               :    instantiation
               c

>>> class T(object):
...     a = 0

>>> class A(T):
...     pass

>>> class B(T):
...     a = 2

>>> class C(A,B):
...     pass

>>> c = C()

Which is the superclass of ``C``? There are two direct superclasses (i.e. bases)
of ``C``: ``A`` and ``B``. ``A`` comes before ``B``, so one would naturally 
think that the superclass of ``C`` is ``A``. Iif ``super(C,c)`` was returning 
the superclass of ``C``, 
then it should return ``A``. ``A`` inherits its attribute ``a`` from ``T``,
where ``a`` has the value 0, so ``super(C,c).a`` should return 0. This
is NOT what happens. Instead, ``super(C,c).a`` walks trought the
method resolution order  of the class of ``c`` (i.e. ``C``) 
and retrieves the attribute from the first class above ``C`` which
defines it. In this example the MRO of ``C`` is ``[C, A, B, T, object]``, so
``B`` is the first class above ``C`` which defines ``a`` and ``super(C,c).a``
correctly returns the value 2, not 0:

>>> super(C,c).a
2

You may call ``A`` the superclass of ``C``, but this is not an useful
concept since the methods are resolved by looking at the classes
in the MRO of ``C``, and not by looking at the classes in the MRO of ``A``
(which in this case is ``[A,T, object]`` and does not contain ``B``). 
The whole MRO is needed, not just the first superclass.

So, using the word *superclass* in the standard doc is completely
misleading and should be avoided altogether.

Second thing: ``super`` returns proxy objects
----------------------------------------------------

Having established that ``super`` cannot return and does not return the
mythical superclass, we may ask ourselves what the hell is returning 
``super`` ;) The truth is that ``super`` returns proxy objects.

Informally speaking, a proxy object is an object with
the ability to dispatch to methods of other classes via delegation.
Technically, ``super`` is a class overriding the ``__getattribute__`` 
method. Instances of ``super`` are proxy objects providing 
access to the methods in the MRO. The dispatch is done in such a way
that

``super(cls, instance-or-subclass).meth(*args, **kw)``

corresponds to

``right-method-in-the-MRO-applied-to(instance-or-subclass, *args, **kw)``

There is a caveat at this point: the second argument can be
an instance of the first argument, or a subclass of it, but
in *both cases* a bound method is returned (one could naively
think that when a subclass is passed one gets an unbound method).

For instance, in this example

.. code-block:: python

 >>> class B(object):
 ...     def __repr__(self):
 ...         return "<instance of %s>" % self.__class__.__name__

 >>> class C(B):
 ...     pass

 >>> class D(C):
 ...     pass

 >>> d = D()

both

.. code-block:: python

 >>> print super(C,d).__repr__
 <bound method D.__repr__ of <instance of D>>

and 


.. code-block:: python

 >>> print super(C,D).__repr__
 <bound method D.__repr__ of <class 'D'>>

returns bound methods. This means that when you call the ``__repr__`` methods,
you will get


.. code-block:: python

 >>> print super(C,d).__repr__()
 <instance of D>

(here ``d``, a ``D`` instance, is being passed to ``__repr__``) and

.. code-block:: python

 >>> print super(C, D).__repr__()
 <instance of type>

(here ``D``, an instance of the (meta)class ``type``, is being passed 
to ``__repr__``).

Reading the docs, one could think that in order to get unbound methods, 
one would need to switch to the alternative syntax of ``super``, the single 
argument syntax. This is actually untrue. To understand how unbound
methods can be retrieved we need to talk about descriptors.

Third thing: ``super`` returns descriptor objects
----------------------------------------------------

Descriptors (more properly I should speak of the descriptor protocol) were 
introduced in Python 2.2 by Guido van Rossum. Their primary motivation 
is technical, since they were needed to implement the new-style object 
system. Descriptors were also used to introduce new standard concepts in 
Python, such as classmethods, staticmethods and properties. Moreover, 
according to the traditional transparency policy of Python, descriptors 
were exposed to the application programmer, giving him/her the freedom
to write custom descriptors.  Any serious Python programmer should have 
a look at descriptors: luckily they are now very well documented (which was
not the case when I first studied them :-/) thanks to the beautiful essay
of Raimond Hettinger [#]_. You should read it before continuing this article, 
since it explains all the details. However, for the sake of our discussion
of ``super``, it is enough to say that a *descriptor class* is just a
regular new-style class which implements a ``.__get__`` method with
signature ``__get__(self, obj, objtyp = None)``. A *descriptor object*
is just an instance of a descriptor class. 

Descriptor objects are intended to be used as attributes (hence their
complete name attribute descriptors). Suppose that ``descr`` is a
given descriptor object used as attribute of a given class C.
Then the syntax ``C.descr`` is actually interpreted by Python as a 
call to ``descr.__get__(None, C)``, whereas the same syntax for an 
instance of C corresponds to a call to ``descr.__get__(c, type(c))``.

The unbound method ``__repr__`` can be retrieved as

.. code-block:: python

 >>> super(C,d).__repr__.__get__(None,D) # or with D instead of d
 <unbound method D.__repr__>

and we may check that it works correctly:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> print _(d)
 <instance of D>

This is cumbersome and tricky, but it is the only way to get
the unbound method. Using the unbound form of ``super`` does 
*not* return ``D.__repr__``: instead it returns ``super.__repr__`` 
bound to the (unbound) super object ``super(C)``:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> print super(C).__repr__() # same as repr(super(C))
 <super: <class 'C'>, NULL>

Very tricky. Notice that ``super`` also redefines ``__new__``, 
``__init``, ``__get__``, ``__getattribute``, as well as inheriting 
other special attributes from ``object``. So using the single-argument
syntax you will dispatch to 
these methods in ``super`` and not to the right methods defined in 
the hierarchy at hand. On the other hand, the two-argument syntax 
does not have this problem. For instance

.. code-block:: python

 >>> print super(C,C).__repr__()
 <instance of type>

does the right thing.

This other example should shed further light. Suppose ``B`` 
has a method called ``meth`` like this:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> B.meth = lambda self :'You called B.meth with first argument %s' % self

Then ``B.meth`` is an unbound method and, mislead by the documentation,
one could expect to be able to access it with the syntax ``super(C).meth``.
This is not the case. You get an error instead:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> super(C).meth
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
 AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 'meth'

Unbound super objects cannot be accessed directly,
they must be converted to bound objects in order to make them
to dispatch properly. Unbound super objects can be converted to
bound super objects via the descriptor protocol. For instance,
in this example I can convert ``super(C)`` in a super object
bound to ``d`` in this way:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> boundsuper = super(C).__get__(d, D) # this is the same as super(C,d)

Now I can access the bound method 'd.meth':

.. code-block:: python

 >>> print boundsuper.meth
 <bound method D.<lambda> of <instance of D>>

As a consequence, ``__get__`` cannot be turned into a cooperative method
just by using ``super``: you would get the wrong ``get``.

Fourth thing: the *unbound* syntax is a mess
------------------------------------------------------------------

Having established that the *unbound* syntax does not return unbound methods 
one might ask what its purpose is.
The answer is that ``super(C)`` is intended to be used as an attribute in 
other classes. Then the descriptor magic will automatically convert the 
unbound syntax in the bound syntax. For instance:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> class B(object):
 ...     a = 1
 >>> class C(B):
 ...     pass
 >>> class D(C):
 ...     sup = super(C)
 >>> d = D()
 >>> d.sup.a
 1

This works since ``d.sup.a`` calls ``super(C).__get__(d,D).a`` which is
converted to ``super(C, d).a`` and retrieves ``B.a``.

There is a single use case for the single argument 
syntax of ``super`` that I am aware of, but I think it gives more troubles 
than advantages. The use case is the implementation of *autosuper* made 
by Guido on his essay about `new-style classes`_.

.. _new-style classes: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2.3/descrintro/#cooperation

The idea there is to use the unbound super objects as private
attributes. For instance, in our example, we could define the
private attribute ``__sup`` in the class ``C`` as the unbound
super object ``super(C)``:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> C._C__sup = super(C)

With this definition inside the methods the syntax 
``self.__sup.meth(arg)`` can be used
as an alternative to ``super(C, self).meth(arg)``, and the advantage is 
that you avoid to repeat the name of the class in the calling
syntax, since that name is hidden in the mangling mechanism of
private names. The creation of the ``__sup`` attributes can be hidden 
in a metaclass and made automatic. So, all this seems to work: but
actually this *not* the case.

Things may wrong in various case, for instance for classmethods,
as in this example:

.. code-block:: python

  #<ex.py>

  class B(object):
      def __repr__(self):
          return '<instance of %s>' % self.__class__.__name__
      def meth(self):
          print "B.meth(%s)" % self
      meth = classmethod(meth)

  class C(B):
      def meth(self):
          print "C.meth(%s)" % self
          self.__super.meth()
      meth = classmethod(meth)

  C._C__super = super(C)

  class D(C):
      pass

  D._D__super = super(D)


  d=D()

  d.meth()

  #</ex.py>

The last line raises an ``AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 
'meth'.``

So, using a ``__super`` unbound super object is not a robust solution
(notice that everything would work by substituting  ``self.__super.meth()``
with ``super(C,self).meth()``. 
In Python 3.0 all this has been resolved in a much better way.

.. There are other ways to avoid repeating the class name, see for instance my cookbook recipe [#]_.

If it was me, I would just remove the single argument syntax of ``super``,
making it illegal. But this would probably break someone code, so
I don't think it will ever happen in Python 2.X. Another solution would be just to
deprecate it. There is no need for this syntax, one can always circumvent 
it.

Fifth thing: ``super`` does not work with meta-attributes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you start using ``super`` intensively, soon or latter you will find
a number of subtilities. One of these is the fact that ``super`` does not 
work well with the ``__name__`` special attribute. Consider this example:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> class B(object):
 ...     "This is class B"
 ... 
 >>> class C(B):
 ...     pass
 ... 

Here the special (class) attribute ``__doc__`` is retrieved as you would expect:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> super(C,C).__doc__ == super(C,C()).__doc__ == B.__doc__
 True

On the other hand, the special attribute ``__name__`` is not 
retrieved correctly:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> super(C,C).__name__ # one would expect it to be 'B'
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
 AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute '__name__'

The problem is that ``__name__`` is not just a plain class
attribute: it is actually a "getset descriptor" defined on
the metaclass "type" (try to run  ``help(type.__dict__['__name__'])``
and you will see for yourself). More in general, ``super`` has
problems with meta-attributes, i.e. class attributes of metaclasses.

Meta-attributes differs from regular attributes since they are not 
transmitted to the instances of the instances.You can find the
rationale for this behaviour elsewhere [#]_: here I am only interested
to the issues with ``super``. Consider this example:

.. code-block:: python

 #<example1.py>

 class M(type):
     "A metaclass with a class attribute 'a'."
     a = 1 

 class B:
     "An instance of M with a meta-attribute 'a'."
     __metaclass__ = M

 class C(B):
     "An instance of M with the same meta-attribute 'a'"

 if __name__ == "__main__":
     print B.a, C.a # => 1 1 
     print super(C,C).a #=> attribute error

 #</example1.py>

If you run this, you will get an attribute error. This is a case
where ``super`` is doing the *right* thing, since 'a' is *not* inherited 
from B, but it comes directly from the metaclass (again, look at my second
article with David Mertz to understand why it is so), so 'a'
is *not* in the MRO of C. A similar thing happens for the ``__name__``
attribute (the fact that it is a descriptor and not a plain 
attribute does not matter), so ``super`` is working correctly, but
still it may seems surprising at first.

Sixth thing: special attribute access for special attributes is special ;)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is also another subtle pitfall which is not directly related
to ``super`` but which is often encountered working with ``super``. 
This came up at least three or four times in the newsgroup, and there 
are various independent bug reports on sourceforge about it, so possibly 
you may face it too. Bjorn Pettersen was the first one who pointed out the
problem to me (see also bug report SF 729913): the issue is that

``super(MyCls, self).__getitem__(5)``

works, but not

``super(MyCls, self)[5]``.

The problem is general to all special methods, not only to ``__getitem__``,
and the explanation for that has to do with the implementation of
attribute lookup for special methods. Clear explanations of what is
going on are provided by Michael Hudson as a comment to the bug report:
SF789262 and by Raymond Hettinger as a comment to the bug report SF805304.
Shortly put, this is not a problem of ``super`` per se, the problem is
that the special call ``x[5]`` (using ``__getitem__`` as example) is
converted to  ``type(x).__getitem__(x,5)``
*only if* ``__getitem__`` is explicitely defined in ``type(x)``. If 
``type(x)`` does not define ``__getitem__`` directly, but only 
indirectly via delegation (i.e. overriding ``__getattribute__``),
then the second form works but not the first one.

This restriction will likely stay in Python because it would involve 
a really big change and a loss of performances, so it has to be
considered just a documentation bug, since nowhere in
the docs it is mentioned that special calling syntaxes (such as
the ``[]`` call, the ``iter`` call, the ``repr`` call, etc. etc.)
are special and bypass ``__getattribute__``. Guido advice is:
just use the more explicit form and everything will work.

Finally, there may be other bugs and pitfalls I am not aware of. Certainly
there are many other issues and bugs in previous versions of Python that
I have not mentioned here, since they have been fixed, but that you may
encounter if you use Python 2.2 (and maybe even in 2.3).

Seventh thing: mixing super and non-super using methods is tricky
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Some years ago James Knight wrote an eassay titled
`Super considered harmful`_ [#]_ where he points out a few shortcomings
of ``super`` and makes an important recommendation: 
*use super consistently, and document that you use it, as it is part of the 
external interface for your class, like it or not*.
The issue is that a developer inheriting from a hierarchy written by somebody
else, has to know if the hierarchy author has used ``super`` internally
or not. For instance, consider this case, where the library author has
used ``super`` internally:

.. code-block:: python

 class A(object):
     def __init__(self):
         print "A",
         super(A, self).__init__()

 class B(object):
     def __init__(self):
         print "B",
         super(B, self).__init__()

If the application programmers knows that the library uses ``super`` internally,
he will use ``super`` and everything will work just fine; but it he does not
know if the library uses ``super`` he may be tempted to call ``A.__init__``
and ``B.__init__`` directly, but this will end up in having ``B.__init__``
called twice! 

.. code-block:: python

 class C(A,B):
     def __init__(self):
         print "C",
         A.__init__(self)
         B.__init__(self)
  
 # c = C() will print 

On the other hand, if the library does not uses ``super`` internally,

.. code-block:: python

 class A(object):
     def __init__(self):
         print "A",

 class B(object):
     def __init__(self):
         print "B",

the application programmer cannot use ``super`` either, otherwise
``B.__init__`` will not be called:

.. code-block:: python

 class C(A,B):
     def __init__(self):
         print "C",
         super(C, self).__init__()

 # c = C() will print

So,  if use a library featuring multiple inheritance, you must know if the
hierarchy was intended to be cooperative (using ``super``) or not.

Eighth thing: argument passing in cooperative methods can fool you
----------------------------------------------------------------------

James Knight devolves a paragraph to the discussion of argument passing
in cooperative methods. Basically, if you want to be safe, all your cooperative
methods should have a compatible signature. There are various ways to
get a compatible signature, for instance you could accept everything (i.e.
your cooperative methods could have signature ``*args, **kw``) which is
a bit too much for me, or all of your methods could have exactly the same
arguments. The issue comes when you have default arguments, since your
MRO can change if you change your hierarchy, and argument passing may
break down. Here is one example

.. code-block:: python

 class A(object):
     def __init__(self):
         print 'A'

 class B(object):
     def __init__(self, a=None):
         print 'B with a=%s' % a
         super(B, self).__init__(a)

 class C(object):
     def __init__(self, a):
         print 'C with a=%s' % a
         super(C, self).__init__()

 class D(B, C):
     def __init__(self):
         print 'D'
         super(D, self).__init__()

 d = D()

This works, but it is fragile (you see what will happen if you change
``D(B,C)`` with ``D(C,B)``?) and in general it is always difficult
to figure out which arguments will be passed to each method and in
which order (the order changing if you change the hierarchy) so it is
best just to use the same arguments everywhere (or not to use
cooperative methods altogether, if you have no need for cooperation).
There is no shortage of examples of trickiness in multiple inheritance
hierarchy; for instance I remember a post from comp.lang.python [#]_
. Also, beware of situations in which you have
some old style classes mixing with new style classes: the result may
depend on the order of the base classes (see examples 2-2b and 2-3b
in `Super considered harmful`_.

.. _Super considered harmful: http://fuhm.net/super-harmful/

Ninth thing: ``super`` had bugs in earlier versions of Python
-----------------------------------------------------------------

There are various ``super`` pitfalls currently undocumented of which
the experienced Python programmer should be aware of.

The unbound form of ``super`` does not play well with pydoc. 
The problems is still there in Python 2.3.4 (see bug report SF729103)

.. code-block:: python

 >>> class B(object): pass
 ... 
 >>> class C(B):
 ...     s=super(B)
 ... 
 >>> help(C)
 Traceback (most recent call last):
   ...
   ... lots of stuff here
   ...
 File "/usr/lib/python2.3/pydoc.py", line 1198, in docother
    chop = maxlen - len(line)
 TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'type' and 'int'

I have not yet clear what the cause is, but it is certainly quite
tricky. An incompatibility between  ``super`` was reported by Christian Tanzer
(SF902628); if you run the following, you will get a TypeError:

.. code-block:: python

  #<ex.py>

  class C(object):
      pass

  C.s = super(C) 

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      import doctest, __main__
      doctest.testmod(__main__)

  #<ex.py>

BTW, I don't think this is related to ``super`` only since I have
found similar problems when playing with descriptors and doctest
some time ago (but I cannot reproduce the bug right now).

Tenth and last thing: when it comes to ``super`` don't trust even Guido himself!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to explain how ``super`` works, Guido describes a
"fully functional implementation of the super() built-in class in 
pure Python" in "Unifying types and classes in Python 2.2".
Unfortunately, that implementation is more harmful than helpful, since
the current ``super`` DOES NOT work in the same way :-(
Take for instance this example:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> class C(object):
 ...    f='C.f'
 >>> class D(C):
 ...    f='D.f'

Here the ``super`` works fine, 

.. code-block:: python

 >>> print super(D,D()).f 
 C.f

but the class ``Super`` described by Guido will raise an attribute
error when invoked as ``Super(D,D()).f``.  Therefore ``Super`` is NOT 
equivalent to the currently implemented ``super`` built-in.

Conclusion: is there life beyond super?
-------------------------------------------------------

In this paper I have argued that ``super`` is tricky,
however the existence of dark corners is not a compelling argument against
a language construct: after all, they are rare and there is an easy solution to
their obscurity, i.e. documenting them.  
Also, even from experience I have come to believe that cooperative
methods are a wart (it is too difficult to reason about them, they are
fragile, and overall I see them as an unneeded complication in 99.9%
of the cases) they have their uses in a multiple inheritance world, as
Guido argues successfully in his essay (the canonical example being a
diamond diagram with ``.save`` methods which must be called
cooperatively).
The problem therefore is not with ``super`` or with cooperative
methods, the problem is with multiple inheritance itself (*if the
implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea*).  

I personally liked super, cooperative methods and multiple inheritance
for a couple of years, then I started working with Zope and my mind
changed completely. The problem is multiple inheritance itself: after
all Zope 2 did not use super at all but is a mess anyway. Inheritance
makes your code heavily coupled and difficult to follow (*spaghetti
inheritance*).  I have not found a real life problem yet that I could
not solve with single inheritance + composition/delegation in a better
and more maintainable way than using multiple inheritance.
Nowadays I use multiple inheritance for quick and dirty hacks,
but never for designing new hierarchies from scratch.
There are alternative to multiple inheritance: for instance Ruby uses 
mixins (they are a restricted multiple inheritance without cooperative
methods and with a well defined superclass, but they do not solve
the issue of name conflicts and the issue with the ordering of
the mixin classes); recently some people proposed the concepts
of traits (restricted mixin where name conflicts must be solved explicitely
and the ordering of the mixins does not matter) which is interesting.
In CLOS multiple inheritance works better since (multi-)methods
are defined outside classes and ``call-next-method`` is well integrated
in the language;
it is simpler to track down the ancestors
of a single method than to wonder about the full class hierarchy.
The language SML (which nobody except academics use, but would deserve
better recognition) goes boldly in the direction of favoring composition over
inheritance and uses functors to this aim. This is an approach I like very
much on the paper, but I lack real experience in a large code base to judge
merits and demerits of this approach.
