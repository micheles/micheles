"super" is one of the trickiest things in Python. I remember having
spent a *lot* of time with it in the past. I keep seeing postings from
people confused about "super" coming in this newsgroup. The current
documentation about "super" is at the best incomplete, in some parts is
misleading and in other parts even wrong. Finally, I decided to write a 
paper telling the truth about super. This is not the whole truth,
however, since I am not enough confident to say that I do understand 
all secrets of "super". I have posted a draft here: 

http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/super.html,

for review from knowledgeable Pythonistas.
Ideally, a corrected/expanded/revision of this draft should go somewhere
in python.org, so people will have a decent reference about "super".
