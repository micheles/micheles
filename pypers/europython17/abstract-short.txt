In this talk I will share some hard-learned knowledge gained in several
years of parallel programming. Covered topics will include
performance, ways to measure the performance, memory occupation, data
transfer and ways to reduce the data transfer, how to debug parallel
programs and useful libraries. I will give some practical examples,
both in enterprise programming (importing CSV files in a database) and
in scientific programming (numerical simulations).
