Can I cut and paste a doctest into IPython?
I mean, if I have the doctest

>>> 1+1
2

and I cut and past it into IPython I obviously get

File "<console>", line 1
     >>> 1+1
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

but I guess there is an automagic option to avoid this. Am I right?

Alternatively, I would like leading spaces to be stripped, so that
I could cut and paste example from a reStructuredText document.
