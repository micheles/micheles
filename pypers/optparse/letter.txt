Okay, finally this Sunday morning I have found the time to finish the optparse 
article :)

I send it to you in reStructuredText format, let me know if you prefer
another format, or if needs some further editing in some part. I also
send you my optionparse module, a wrapper which makes optparse easier
to use.
