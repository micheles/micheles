<p><em>The optparse module is a powerful, flexible, extensible, easy-to-use 
command-line parsing library for Python. Using optparse, you can add 
intelligent, sophisticated handling of command-line options to your 
scripts with very little overhead.</em> -- Greg Ward, optparse author</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h1><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Once upon a time, when graphic interfaces were still to be dreamed
about, command-line tools were the body and the soul of all programming
tools. Many years have passed since then, but some things have not 
changed: command-line tools are still fast, efficient, portable, easy 
to use and - more importantly - reliable. You can count on them.
You can expect command-line scripts to work in any situation, 
during the installation phase, in a situation of disaster recovery, when 
your window manager breaks down and even in systems with severe 
memory/hardware constraints. When you really need them, command-line 
tools are always there.</p>
<p>Hence, it is important for a programming language - especially
one that wants to be called a &quot;scripting&quot; language - to provide 
facilities to help the programmer in the task of writing command-line 
tools. For a long time Python support for this kind of tasks has 
been provided by the``getopt`` module. I have never 
been particularly fond of <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">getopt</span></tt>, since it required 
a sensible amount of coding even for the parsing of simple 
command-lines. However, with the coming of Python 2.3 the situation 
has changed: thanks to the great job of Greg Ward (the author of 
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> a.k.a. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">Optik</span></tt>) now the Python programmer 
has at her disposal (in the standard library and not as an 
add-on module) a fully fledged Object Oriented API for 
command-line arguments parsing, which makes writing Unix-style 
command-line tools easy, efficient and fast.</p>
<p>The only disadvantage of <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> is that it is  
sophisticated tool, which requires some time to be fully mastered. 
The purpose of this paper is to help the reader to rapidly get the 
10% of the features of <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> that she will use in the 90% of 
the cases. Taking as an example a real life application - a search and 
replace tool -  I will guide the reader through (some of) the wonders 
of <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt>. Also, I will show some trick that will make your life 
with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> much happier. 
This paper is intended for both Unix and
Windows programmers - actually I will argue that Windows programmers 
need <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> even more than Unix programmers; it does not
require any particular expertise to be fully appreciated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-simple-example">
<h1><a name="a-simple-example">A simple example</a></h1>
<p>I will take as pedagogical example a little tool I wrote some time ago,
a multiple files search and replace tool. I needed it because I am 
not always working under Unix, and I do not always have sed/awk or
even Emacs installed, so it made sense to have this 
little Python script in my toolbox. It is only few lines long,
it can always be modified and extended with a minimal effort,
works on every platform (including my PDA) and has the advantage 
of being completely command-line driven: 
it does not require to have any graphics library installed
and I can use it when I work on a remote machine via ssh.</p>
<p>The tool takes a bunch of files and replace a given regular expression 
everywhere in-place; moreover, it saves a backup copy of the original 
un-modified files and give the option to recover 
them when I want to.  Of course, all of this can be done more efficiently 
in the Unix world with specialized tools, but those tools are written 
in C and they are not as easily customizable as a Python script, that 
you may change in real time to suit your needs. So, it makes sense 
to write this kind of utilities in Python, and actually many people 
(including myself) are actively replacing some Unix commands and bash 
scripts with Python scripts. In real life, I have extended a lot 
the minimal tool that I describe here, and I continue to tune it as 
needed. For instance, you can make it to work recursively and/or on
remote directories.</p>
<p>As a final note, let me notice that I find <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> 
to be much more useful in the Windows world than in the Unix/Linux/Mac OS X
world. The reason is that the pletora 
of pretty good command-line tools which are available under Unix are 
missing in the Windows environment, or do not have a satisfactory 
equivalent. Therefore, 
it makes sense to write a personal collection of command-line scripts 
for your more common task, if you need to work on many platforms and
portability is an important requirement. 
Using Python and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt>, you may write your own scripts 
once and having them to run on every platform running Python, 
which means in practice any traditional platform and increasingly
more of the non-traditional ones - Python is spreading into the 
embedded market too, including PDA's, cellular phones, and more.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-unix-philosophy-for-command-line-arguments">
<h1><a name="the-unix-philosophy-for-command-line-arguments">The Unix philosophy for command-line arguments</a></h1>
<p>In order to understand how <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> works, it is essential
to understand the Unix philosophy about command-lines arguments. 
As Greg Ward puts it:</p>
<p><em>The purpose of optparse is to make it very easy to provide the 
most standard, obvious, straightforward, and user-friendly user 
interface for Unix command-line programs. The optparse philosophy 
is heavily influenced by the Unix and GNU toolkits ...</em></p>
<p>So, I think my Windows readers will be best served if I put here
a brief summary of the Unix terminology. Old time Unix geeks may safely 
skip this section. Let me just notice that <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> could be 
extended to implement other kinds of conventions for optional argument 
parsing..</p>
<p>Here is optparse/Unix/GNU terminology:
the arguments given to a command-line script - <em>i.e.</em>  the arguments
that Python stores in the list <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">sys.argv[1:]</span></tt> - are classified in
three groups: options, option arguments and positional arguments. 
Options can be distinguished since they are prefixed by a dash
or a double dash; options can have arguments or not 
(there is at most an option argument right after each option); 
options without arguments are called flags. Positional arguments 
are what it is left in the command-line after you remove options 
and option arguments.</p>
<p>In the example of the search/replace tool, 
I will need two options with an argument - since I want 
to pass to the script a regular expression and a replacement string - 
and I will need a flag specifying whether or not a backup of the original 
files needs to be performed. Finally, I will need a number of positional
arguments to store the names of the files on which the search and
replace will act.</p>
<p>Consider - for the sake of the example - the following situations:
you have a bunch of text files in the current directory containing dates 
in the European format DD-MM-YYYY, and that you want to convert them in
the American format MM-DD-YYYY. If you are sure that all your dates
are in the correct format, your can match them with a simple regular
expression such as <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">(\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)</span></tt>
(this regular expression looks for strings composed of three
groups of digits separated by dashes, with the first and
second group composed by two digits and the last group
composed by four digits).</p>
<p>In this particular example it is not so important to make a backup
copy of the original files, since to revert to the original
format it is enough to run the script again. So the syntax to use 
would be something like</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
$&gt; replace.py --nobackup --regx=&quot;(\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)&quot; \
                         --repl=&quot;\2-\1-\3&quot; *.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to emphasize the portability, I have used a generic 
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">$&gt;</span></tt> promtp, meaning that these examples work equally well on
both Unix and Windows (of course on Unix I could do the same 
job with sed or awk, but these tools are not as flexible as
a Python script).</p>
<p>The syntax here has the advantage of being
quite clear, but the disadvantage of being quite verbose, and it is
handier to use abbreviations for the name of the options. For instance, 
sensible abbreviations can be <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-x</span></tt> for <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">--regx</span></tt>, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-r</span></tt> for <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">--repl</span></tt> 
and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-n</span></tt> for <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">--nobackup</span></tt>; moreover, the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">=</span></tt> sign can safely be
removed. Then the previous command reads</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
$&gt; replace.py -n -x&quot;(\dd)-(\dd)-(\d\d\d\d)&quot; -r&quot;\2-\1-\3&quot; *.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You see here the Unix convention at work: one-letter options
(a.k.a. short options) are prefixed with a single dash, whereas 
long options are prefixed with a double dash. The advantage of the 
convention is that short options can be composed: for instance</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
$&gt; replace.py -nx &quot;(\dd)-(\dd)-(\d\d\d\d)&quot; -r &quot;\2-\1-\3&quot; *.txt
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>means the same as the previous line, i.e. <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-nx</span></tt> is parsed as
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-n</span> <span class="pre">-x</span></tt>.  You can also freely exchange the order of the options,
for instance in this way:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
$&gt; replace.py -nr &quot;\2-\1-\3&quot; *.txt -x &quot;(\dd)-(\dd)-(\d\d\d\d)&quot;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This command will be parsed exactly as before, i.e. options and option 
arguments are not positional.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-does-it-work-in-practice">
<h1><a name="how-does-it-work-in-practice">How does it work in practice?</a></h1>
<p>Having stated the requirements, we may start implementing our 
search and replace tool. The first step, and the most important
one, is to write down the documentation string, even if you 
will have to wait until the last section to understand
why the docstring is the most important part of this script ;)</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/env python
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Given a sequence of text files, replaces everywhere
a regular expression x with a replacement string s.

  usage: %prog files [options]
  -x, --regx=REGX: regular expression
  -r, --repl=REPL: replacement string
  -n, --nobackup: do not make backup copies
&quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>On Windows the first line in unnecessary, but is good practice to have it 
in the Unix world.</p>
<p>The next step is to write down a simple search and replace routine:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
import re

def replace(regx, repl, files, backup_option=True):
    rx = re.compile(regx)
    for fname in files:
        txt = file(fname, &quot;U&quot;).read()
        if backup_option:
            print &gt;&gt; file(fname+&quot;.bak&quot;, &quot;w&quot;), txt,
        print &gt;&gt; file(fname, &quot;w&quot;), rx.sub(repl, txt),
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This replace routine is entirely unsurprising, the only thing you
may notice is the usage of the &quot;U&quot; option in the line</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
txt=file(fname,&quot;U&quot;).read()
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a new feature of Python 2.3. Text files open with the &quot;U&quot;
option are read in &quot;Universal&quot; mode: this means that Python takes
care for you of the newline pain, i.e. this script will work 
correctly everywhere, independently by the newline
conventions of your operating system. The script works by reading 
the whole file in memory: this is bad practice, and here I am assuming 
that you will use this script only on short files that will fit in 
your memory, otherwise you should &quot;massage&quot; the code a bit.
Also, a full fledged script would check if the file exists 
and can be read, and would do something in the case it is not,
but I ask you to forgive me for skipping on these points,
since the thing I am really interested in is the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt>
module.</p>
<p>So, how does it work? It is quite simple, really. 
First you need to instantiate an argument line parser from
the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">OptionParser</span></tt> class provided by <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt>:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
import optparse 
parser = optparse.OptionParser(&quot;usage: %prog files [options]&quot;)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The string <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">&quot;usage:</span> <span class="pre">%prog</span> <span class="pre">files</span> <span class="pre">[options]&quot;</span></tt> will be used to
print a customized usage message,  where <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">%prog</span></tt> will be replaced
by the name of the script (in this case <cite>replace.py`</cite>). You
may safely omit it and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> will use a default 
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">&quot;usage:</span> <span class="pre">%prog</span> <span class="pre">[options]&quot;</span></tt> string.</p>
<p>Then, you tell the parser informations about which options
it must recognize:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
parser.add_option(&quot;-x&quot;, &quot;--regx&quot;,
                help=&quot;regular expression&quot;)
parser.add_option(&quot;-r&quot;, &quot;--repl&quot;,
                help=&quot;replacement string&quot;)
parser.add_option(&quot;-n&quot;, &quot;--nobackup&quot;,
                action=&quot;store_true&quot;,
                help=&quot;do not make backup copies&quot;)
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">help</span></tt> keyword argument is intended to document the
intent of the given option; it is also used by <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> in the 
usage message. The <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">action=store_true</span></tt> keyword argument is
used to distinguish flags from options with arguments, it tells
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> to set the flag <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">nobackup</span></tt> to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">True</span></tt> if <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-n</span></tt>
or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">--nobackup</span></tt> is given in the command line.</p>
<p>Finally, you tell the parse to do its job and to parse the command line:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
option, files = parser.parse_args()
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">.parse_args()</span></tt> method returns two values: <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">option</span></tt>, 
which is an instance of the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse.Option</span></tt> class, and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">files</span></tt>,
which is a list of positional arguments.
The <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">option</span></tt> object has attributes - called <em>destionations</em> in 
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> terminology - corresponding to the given options.
In our example, <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">option</span></tt> will have the attributes <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">option.regx</span></tt>, 
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">option.repl</span></tt> and  <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">option.nobackup</span></tt>.</p>
<p>If no options are passed to the command line, all these attributes
are initialized to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">None</span></tt>, otherwise they are initialized to 
the argument option. In particular flag options are initialized to 
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">True</span></tt> if they are given, to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">None</span></tt> otherwise. So, in our example 
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">option.nobackup</span></tt> is <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">True</span></tt> if the flag <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">-n</span></tt> or <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">--nobackup</span></tt> 
is given.
The list <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">files</span></tt> contains the files passed
to the command line (assuming you passed
the names of accessible text files in your system).</p>
<p>The main logic can be as simple as the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
if not files:
    print &quot;No files given!&quot;
elif option.regx and option.repl:
    replace(option.regex, option.repl, files, not option.nobackup)
else:
    print &quot;Missing options or unrecognized options.&quot;
    print __doc__ # documentation on how to use the script
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>A nice feature of <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> is that an help option is automatically
created, so <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">replace.py</span> <span class="pre">-h</span></tt> (or  <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">replace.py</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></tt>) will work as
you may expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
$&gt; replace.py --help
usage: replace.py files [options]


options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -xREGX, --regx=REGX  regular expression
  -rREPL, --repl=REPL  replacement string
  -n, --nobackup       do not make backup copies
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>You may programmatically print the usage message by invoking  
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">parser.print_help()</span></tt>.</p>
<p>At this point you may test your script and see that it works as
advertised.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-reduce-verbosity-and-make-your-life-with-optparse-happier">
<h1><a name="how-to-reduce-verbosity-and-make-your-life-with-optparse-happier">How to reduce verbosity and make your life with <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> happier</a></h1>
<p>The approach we followed in the previous example has a disadvantage: 
it involves a certain amount of verbosity/redundance. Suppose for instance 
we want to add the ability to restore the original file from the backup copy.
Then, we have to change the script in three points: in the docstring,
in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">add_option</span></tt> list, and in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">if</span> <span class="pre">..</span> <span class="pre">elif</span> <span class="pre">..</span> <span class="pre">else</span> <span class="pre">...</span></tt> 
statement. At least one of this is redundant.
One would be tempted to think that the information in the documentation
string is redundant, since it is already magically provided in the help
options: however, I will take the opposite view, that the information
in the help options is redundant, since it is already contained in
the docstring.  It is a sacrilege to write a Python script without a 
docstring, since the docstring should always be available to automatic 
documentation tools such as pydoc.
Since the docstring cannot be removed or shortened, the idea is to 
extract information from it, in such a way to avoid the boring task 
of writing by hand the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">parser.add_option</span></tt> lines. 
I implemented this idea in a cookbook recipe, by writing an 
<tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optionparse</span></tt> module which is just a thin wrapper around <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt>.
The relevant code is <a class="reference" href="optionparse.py">here</a>. The relevant functions are <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optionparse.parse</span></tt>
which parses the docstring and <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optionparse.exit</span></tt> which exits the
execution by displaying an usage message.
To show how to use them, let me rewrite the
search and replace tool (including the new restore option) in this way:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/usr/bin/env python
&quot;&quot;&quot;
Given a sequence of text files, replaces everywhere
a regular expression x with a replacement string s.

  usage: %prog files [options]
  -x, --regx=REGX: regular expression
  -r, --repl=REPL: replacement string
  -n, --nobackup: do not make backup copies
  -R, --restore: restore the original from the backup
&quot;&quot;&quot;
import optionparse, os, shutil, re

def replace(regx, repl, files, backup_option=True):
    rx = re.compile(regx)
    for fname in files:
        # TODO: add a test to see if the file exists and can be read
        txt = file(fname, &quot;U&quot;).read()
        if backup_option:
            print &gt;&gt; file(fname+&quot;.bak&quot;, &quot;w&quot;), txt
        print &gt;&gt; file(fname, &quot;w&quot;), rx.sub(repl,txt)

def restore(files): # restor original files from backup files
    for fname in files:       
        if os.path.exists(fname+&quot;.bak&quot;):
            shutil.copyfile(fname+&quot;.bak&quot;,fname)
        else:
            print &quot;Sorry, there is no backup copy for %s&quot; % fname

if __name__=='__main__':
    option, files = optionparse.parse(__doc__)
    # optionparse.parse parses both the docstring and the command line!
    if not files:
        optionparse.exit()
    elif option.regx and option.repl:
        replace(option.regex, option.repl, files, not option.nobackup)
    elif option.restore:
        restore(files)
    else:
        print &quot;Missing options or unrecognized options.&quot;
</pre>
<p>The code is quite readable. Internally <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optionparse.parse(__doc__)</span></tt> 
works by generating an option parser from the docstring, then applying it
to the command-line arguments. 
Working a bit more, one could also devise various tricks to avoid
the redundance in the <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt> statement (for instance using a
dictionary of functions and dispatching according to the name of
the given option). However this simple recipe is good enough to
provide a minimal wrapper to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt>. It requires a minimum effort
and works well for the most common case. For instance, the paper you are 
reading now has been written by using <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optionparse</span></tt>: I used it to 
write a simple wrapper to docutils - the standard
Python tool which converts (restructured) text files to HTML pages. 
It is also nice to notice that internally
docutils itself uses <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> to do its job, so actually this
paper has been composed by using <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> twice!</p>
<p>Finally, you should keep in mind that this article only scratch the
surface of <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt>, which is quite sophisticated. 
For instance you can specify default values, different destinations, 
a <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">store_false</span></tt> action and much more, even if often you don't need 
all this power. Still, it is handy to have the power at your disposal when 
you need it.  The serious user of <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt> is strongly 
encorauged to read the documentation in the standard library, which 
is pretty good and detailed. I will think that this article has fullfilled
its function of &quot;appetizer&quot; to <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">optparse</span></tt>, if it has stimulate 
the reader to study more.</p>
