*The optparse module is a powerful, flexible, extensible, easy-to-use 
command-line parsing library for Python. Using optparse, you can add 
intelligent, sophisticated handling of command-line options to your 
scripts with very little overhead.* -- Greg Ward, optparse author

Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once upon a time, when graphic interfaces were still to be dreamed
about, command line tools were the body and the soul of all programming
tools. Many years have passed since then, but some things have not 
changed: command line tools are still fast, efficient, portable, easy 
to use and - more importantly - reliable. You can count on them.
You can expect command line scripts to work in any situation, 
during the installation phase, in a situation of disaster recovery, when 
your window manager breaks down and even in systems with severe 
memory/hardware constraints. When you really need them, command 
line tools are always there. 

Hence, it is important for a programming language - especially
one that wants to be called a "scripting" language - to provide 
facilities to help the programmer in the task of writing command
line tools. For a long time Python support for this kind of 
tasks has been devoted to the old fashioned ``getopt`` module. I have
never been particularly fond of ``getopt``, since it required the programmer 
to do a sensible amount of boring job even for the parsing of simple 
argument lines. However, with the coming of Python 2.3 the situation 
has changed: thanks to the great job of Greg Ward (the author of 
``optparse`` and ``Optik``, its precursor) now the Python programmer 
has at her disposal - in the standard library and not as an 
add-on module - a fully fledged Object Oriented API for command 
line arguments parsing, which makes writing Unix-style command 
line tools easy, efficient and fast.

The only "disadvantage" of ``optparse`` is that it is a kind of 
sophisticated tool, and requires some time to be fully mastered. 
The purpose of this paper is to help the reader to rapidly get the 
10% of the features of ``optparse`` that you will use in the 90% of 
the cases. Taking as an example a real life application - a search and 
replace tool -  I will guide the reader through (some of) the wonders 
of ``optparse``, showing how simple is to use it. Also, I will 
show some trick that will make your life with ``optparse`` much easier. 
This paper is intended for both Unix and
Windows programmers - actually I will argue that Windows programmers 
need ``optparse`` even more than Unix programmers - and does not
require any particular expertise to be fully appreciated.

A simple example
---------------------------------------

I will take as pedagogical example a little tool I wrote in real life,
a multiple files search and replace tool. I needed it because I am 
not always working under Unix, and not always I have Emacs or 
another powerful editor installed, so it made sense to have this 
little Python script in my toolbox. It is only few lines long,
it can always be modified and extended with a minimal effort,
works on every platform (including my PDA) and has the advantage 
of being completely command line driven: 
it does not require to have any graphics library installed
and I can use it when I work on a remote machine via ssh.

The tool takes a bunch of files, look for a given regular expression 
and replace it everywhere in-place; moreover, it saves a backup copy of
the original un-modified files and give the option to recover 
them if I want to.  All of this can be done more efficiently in the 
Unix world with ``sed`` or other tools, but those tools are written 
in C and they are not as easily customizable as a Python script, that 
you may change in real time to suit your needs. So, it makes sense 
to write command line tools in Python, and actually many people 
(including myself) are actively replacing bash scripts with Python 
scripts which wraps Unix tools or even replace them, if easy of modification
is an important requirement. So, in real life, I have hacked
quite a lot the minimal tool that I am describing here, and my 
real tool does much more than that.

Also - as a side note - let me notice that I find ``optparse`` 
to be much more useful in a Windows environment than in the Unix world, 
including in the term the various flavors of Linux and Mac OS X. 
The reason is that the pletora 
of pretty good command line tools which are available under Unix are 
missing in a Windows environment, or do not have a satisfactory 
equivalent. Therefore, 
it makes sense to write a personal collection of command line scripts 
for your more common task, if you need to work on many platforms and
portability is an important requirement. 
Using Python and ``optparse``, you may write your own scripts 
once and having them to run on every platform running Python, 
which means in practice any traditional platform and increasingly
more of the non-traditional ones - notice for instance that Python 
is expanding to the embedded market too, including PDA's, cellular 
phones, and more.

The Unix philosophy for command line arguments
-------------------------------------------------

In order to understand how ``optparse`` works, it is essential
to understand the Unix terminology about command lines arguments. 
As Greg Ward puts it:

*The purpose of optparse is to make it very easy to provide the 
most standard, obvious, straightforward, and user-friendly user 
interface for Unix command-line programs. The optparse philosophy 
is heavily influenced by the Unix and GNU toolkits ...*

So, I think my Windows readers will be best served if I put here
a brier summary of the Unix terminology. Old time Unix programmers may safely 
skip this section. ``optparse`` could easily be extended to implement 
other kinds of conventions for optional argument parsing, but very likely
you *don't want* to do that, since the Unix conventions make a lot of sense.

Here is optparse/Unix/GNU terminology:
the arguments given to a command line script - *i.e.*  the arguments
that Python stores in the list ``sys.argv[1:]`` - are classified as 
positional arguments, options and option arguments. 
Options can be distinguished since they are prefixed by a dash ``-`` 
or a double dash ``--``; options can have option arguments or not 
(there is at most an option argument right after each option); 
options without arguments are called flags. Positional arguments 
are what it is left in the command line and it is not an option or
an option argument.

For instance, in the example of the search/replace tool I was
talking about, I will have three options, since I want to pass to
the script a regular expression, a replacement string, and a
flag specifying if a backup of the original files has to be
performed or not. Both the regular expression option and the
replacement string option require an argument, whereas the
backup option does not require an argument and it is just a
flag: or it is given, or it is not given. 

Consider - for the sake of the example - the following situations:
you have a bunch of
text files in my current directory containing dates in the
European format DD-MM-YYYY, and that I want to convert them in
the American format MM-DD-YYYY. If I am sure that all my dates
are in the correct format, I can match them with a simple regular
expression such as ``(\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)`` . Notice that
this regular expression can be complicated at will, or can be 
written differently, but it is enough for the purpose of this 
paper and has the advantage of being simple enough to be
understood even by readers with very little familiarity with 
regexes (it essentially looks for strings composed of the
groups of digits separated by dashes, with the first and
second group composed by two digits and the last group
composed by four digits).

In this particular example it is not so important to make a backup
copy of the original files, since to reverts to the original
format it is enough to run again the script: then the position
of the month will be switched again back to the European 
convention. So the syntax to use would be something like

 ::

  $> replace.py --nobackup --regx="(\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)" --repl="\2-\1-\3" *.txt


In order to emphasize the portability, I have used a generic 
``$>`` promtp, meaning that these examples works equally well both on
Unix and on Windows. 

The double slash syntax has the advantage of being
quite clear, but the disadvantage of being quite verbose, and it is
handier to use abbreviations for the name of the options. For instance, 
sensible abbreviations can be ``-x`` for ``--regx``, ``-r`` for ``--repl`` 
and ``-n`` for ``--nobackup``; moreover, the ``=`` sign can safely be
removed. Then the previous command reads

 ::

  $> replace.py -n -x"(\dd)-(\dd)-(\d\d\d\d)" -r"\2-\1-\3" *.txt

You see here the Unix convention at work: one-letter options
(a.k.a. short options) are prefixed with a single dash, whereas 
long options are prefixed with a double dash. The advantage of the 
convention is that short options can be composed: for instance

 ::

  $> replace.py -nx "(\dd)-(\dd)-(\d\d\d\d)" -r "\2-\1-\3" *.txt

means the same as the previous line, i.e. ``-nx`` is parsed as
``-n -x``.  You can also freely exchange the order of the options
(provided option arguments are kept right 
after their respective options):

 ::

  $> replace.py -nr "\2-\1-\3" *.txt -x "(\dd)-(\dd)-(\d\d\d\d)"

This command will be parsed exactly as before, since options and option 
arguments are not positional. 

How does it work in practice?
-----------------------------

So, I have stated the requirements. At this point we may start writing
our search and replace tool. The first step, and the most important
one, is to write down the documentation string:

 ::

  #!/usr/bin/env python
  """
  Given a sequence of text files, replaces everywhere
  a regular expression x with a replacement string s.

    usage: %prog files [options]
    -x, --regx=REGX: regular expression
    -r, --repl=REPL: replacement string
    -n, --nobackup: don't make backup copies
  """

You will have to wait until the last section to understand
why the docstring is the most important part of this script ;)
Here I just notice, for the sake of Windows users,
that the first line is not needed if you work on
Windows only, where it is just a comment, but in
the Unix world it is important since it allows the
shell to recognize the script as a python script.
So, it is a good habit to use it, it is harmless in Windows
and helpful in Unix.

The next step is to write down a simple search and replace routine:

 ::
 
  import optparse, re

  def replace(regx,repl,files,backup_option=True):
      rx=re.compile(regx)
      for fname in files:
          txt=file(fname,"U").read()
          if backup_option:
              print >> file(fname+".bak", "w"), txt,
          print >> file(fname,"w"), rx.sub(repl,txt),

This replace routine is entirely unsurprising, the only thing you
may notice is the usage of the "U" option in the line

 ::

     txt=file(fname,"U").read()

This is a new feature of Python 2.3. Text files open with the "U"
option are read in "Universal" mode: this means that Python takes
care for you of the newline pain, i.e. this script will work 
correctly everywhere, independently by the newline
conventions of your operating system. Notice that the script
works by reading the whole file in memory: this is bad practice,
and here I am assuming that you will use this script only on short 
files that will fit in you memory, otherwise you should "massage"
a bit the code.
Also, a fully fledget script would check if the file exists 
and can be read, and would do something in the case it is not,
but I think you will forbid me for skipping on these points,
since the thing I am really interested in is the ``optparse``
module that, as I am sure you noticed, I have already imported 
at the top.

So, how does it work? It is quite simple, really. 
First you need to instantiate an argument line parser from
the ``OptionParser`` class provided by ``optparse``:

 ::

  parser = optparse.OptionParser("usage: %prog files [options]")

The string ``"usage: %prog files [options]"`` will be used to
print an customized usage message,  where %prog will be replaced
by the name of the script - in this case - ``replace.py``. You
may safely omit it and ``optparse`` will use a default 
``"usage: %prog [options]"`` string.

Then, you tell the parser informations about which options
it must recognize:

 ::

  parser.add_option("-x", "--regx",
                  help="regular expression")
  parser.add_option("-r", "--repl",
                  help="replacement string")
  parser.add_option("-n", "--nobackup",
                  action="store_true",
                  help="do not make backup copies")

The ``help`` keyword argument is intended to document the
intent of the given option; it is also used by ``optparse`` in the 
usage message. The ``action=store_true`` keyword argument is
used to distinguish flags from options with arguments, it tells
``optparse`` to set the flag ``nobackup`` to ``True`` if ``-n``
or ``--nobackup`` is given in the command line.

Finally, you tell the parse to do its job and to parse the command line:

 ::

  option, files = parser.parse_args()

The ``.parse_args()`` method returns two values: an object ``option``, 
which is an instance of the ``optparse.Option`` class, and a list
of positional arguments
The ``option`` object has attributes - called *destionations* in 
``optparse`` terminology - corresponding to the given options.
In our example, ``option`` will have the attributes ``option.regx``, 
``option.repl`` and  ``option.nobackup``.

If no options are passed to the command line, all these attributes
are initialized to ``None``, otherwise they are initialized to 
the argument option. In particular flag options are initialized to 
``True`` if they are given, to``None`` otherwise. So, in our example 
``option.nobackup`` is ``True`` if the flag ``-n`` or ``--nobackup`` 
is given.
The list ``files`` in our example contains the files passed
to the command line that must be replaced (assuming you passed
the names of accessible files in your system).

At this point, we may dispatch to the right routines according to
the given command line with a simple ``if`` statement such as the
following:

 ::

      if not files:
          print "No files given!"
      elif option.regx and option.repl:
          replace(option.regex, option.repl, files, not option.nobackup)
      else:
          print "Missing options or unrecognized options."
	  print __doc__ # documentation on how to use the script

A nice feature of ``optparse`` is that an help option is automatically
created, so ``replace.py -h`` (or  ``replace.py --help``) will work as
you may expect:

 ::

  $> replace.py --help
  usage: replace.py files [options]


  options:
    -h, --help           show this help message and exit
    -xREGX, --regx=REGX  regular expression
    -rREPL, --repl=REPL  replacement string
    -n, --nobackup       do not make backup copies


You may programmatically print the usage message by invoking  
``parser.print_help()``.

At this point you may test your script and see that it works as
advertised.

How to reduce verbosity and make your life with ``optparse`` happier
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The approach we followed in the previous example has a disadvantage 
verbosity/redundance. Suppose for instance we want to add another 
option to the script, for instance the ability to restore the original file 
from the backup copy, which is quite handy in the case something goes 
wrong with the replace.
Then, we have to change the script in three points: in the docstring,
in the ``add_option`` list, and in the ``if .. elif .. else ...`` 
statement. At least one of this is redundant.
One would be tempted to think that the information in the documentation
string is redundant, since it is already magically provided in the help
options: however, I will take the opposite view, that the information
in the help options is redundant, since it is already contained in
the docstring.  It is a kind of sacrilege to write a Python script 
without a docstring explaining what it does, so the docstring cannot 
be removed or shortened, since it must be available to automatic
documentation tools such as pydoc. So, the idea is to 
extract information from the docstring, and to avoid altogether 
the boring task of writing by hand the ``parser.add_option`` lines. 
I implemented this idea in a cookbook recipe, by writing an 
``optionparse`` module which is just a thin wrapper around ``optparse``.
Interested readers may look at the implementation at ...,

here I just show how the script (including the new restore option)
will look by using my ``optionparse`` wrapper:

 ::

  #!/usr/bin/env python
  """
  Given a sequence of text files, replaces everywhere
  a regular expression x with a replacement string s.
  
    usage: %prog files [options]
    -x, --regx=REGX: regular expression
    -r, --repl=REPL: replacement string
    -n, --nobackup: do not make backup copies
    -R, --restore: restore the original from the backup
  """
  import optionparse, os, shutil, re
  
  def replace(regx,repl,files,backup_option=True):
      rx=re.compile(regx)
      for fname in files:
          # you could a test to see if the file exists and can be read here
          txt=file(fname,"U").read()
          if backup_option:
              print >> file(fname+".bak","w"), txt
          print >> file(fname,"w"), rx.sub(repl,txt)
  
  def restore(files):
      for fname in files:	
          if os.path.exists(fname+".bak"):
              shutil.copyfile(fname+".bak",fname)
          else:
              print "Sorry, there is no backup copy for %s" % fname
  
  if __name__=='__main__':
      option,files=optionparse.parse(__doc__)
      # optionparse.parse parses both the docstring and the command line!
      if not files:
          optionparse.exit()
      elif option.regx and option.repl:
          replace(option.regex, option.repl, files, not option.nobackup)
      elif option.restore:
          restore(files)
      else:
          print "Missing options or unrecognized options."

Working a bit more, one could also devise various tricks to avoid
the redundance in the ``if`` statement (for instance using a
dictionary of functions and dispatching according to the name of
the given option). However this simple recipe is good enough to
provide a minimal wrapper to ``optparse`` with requires a minimum effort
as it works well for the most common case. For instance, the same 
paper you are reading now, has been written by using it: I used 
``optionparse`` to write a simple wrapper to docutils - the standard
Python tools to convert text files to HTML pages - to customize 
its behavior to my needs. It is also nicer to notice that internally
docutils itself uses ``optparse`` to do its job, so actually this
paper has been composed by using ``optparse`` twice!
 
Finally, you should keep in mind that this article only scratch the
surface of ``optparse``, which is quite sophisticated. 
For instance you can specify default values, different destinations, 
a ``store_false`` action and much more, even if often you don't need 
all this power. Still, it is handy to have it at your disposal when 
you need it.  So, the serious user of ``optparse`` is strongly 
encorauged to read the standard documentation coming with it, which 
is quite good and detailed. I will think that this article has fullfilled
its function of "appetizer" to ``optparse``, if it has stimulate 
the reader to dive into ``optparse``.
