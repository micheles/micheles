How to migrate from PostgreSQL to HDF5 and live happily ever after
==================================================================

This talk is for people who have a lot of floating numbers inside
PostgreSQL tables and have problems with that. I will narrate my
experience with a scientific project that used PostgreSQL as storage
for a rather complex set of composite multidimensional arrays and ran
into all sorts of performances issues, both in reading and writing the
data.  I will discuss the issues and the approach that was taken first
to mitigate them (unsuccessfully) and then to remove them
(successfully) by a complete rethinking of the underlying architecture
and eventually the removal of the database. I will talk about the
migration strategies that were employed in the transition period and
how to live with a mixed environment of metadata in PostgreSQL and
data in an HDF5 file. I will also talk about concurrency, since the
underlying application is distributed and massively parallel, and
still it uses the purely sequential version of HDF5. Questions from
the audience are expected and welcome.
The talk is of interest to a large public, since it is mostly about
measuring things, monitoring and testing a legacy system,
making sure that the changes do not break the previous behavior
and keeping the users happy, while internally rewriting
all of the original code. And doing that in a small enough number of years!
