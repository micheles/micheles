This talk is for people who have a lot of floating numbers inside
PostgreSQL tables. I will bring as an example my personal experience
with a scientific project that used PostgreSQL as storage for a rather
complex set of composite multidimensional arrays and ran into all
sorts of performances issues, both in reading and writing the data. I
will explain how I solved all that by dropping the database in favor
of an HDF5 file, while keeping the application running and the users
happy.
