<p>Hi Harald,</p>
<p>I was looking at your suggestions again:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&quot;&quot;&quot;
a) some real &quot;hello world&quot; stuff
b) tricks and powers of the interactive console
c) dynamic modules taken from
- web scraping with python (beautifull soup, urllib..)
- database access (WITHOUT sqlobject, which is presented seperately)
- some basic system Administration Stuff
- do a PDF
&quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p>I think we should decide how to split this stuff between us and
also have an idea of the time needed. I could do</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>A superfast toor of IPython (10 minutes)</li>
<li>reStructuredText, how to make Web pages and PDFs (15 minutes)</li>
<li>Twill, i.e. how to interact with the Web the easy way (10 minutes)</li>
</ol>
<p>The time are indicatives i.e. they could easily become longer (but not
much shorter, unless we kill something). According to the interests of people 
times and topics could change at run time, but I think its is best if we have 
prepared at least a provisional program. BTW, if you don't know about Twill, 
here is a reference:</p>
<p><a class="reference" href="http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/twill/README.html">http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/twill/README.html</a></p>
<p>It is so easy to use that it makes a good candidate even for a 
total beginner course and on the other hand it is useful even to
the expert Web developer. I am writing a paper on it for O'Reilly,
so I am already prepared ;)</p>
