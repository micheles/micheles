SOLVING THE METACLASS CONFLICT
=========================================================================

Summary:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any serious user of metaclasses has been bitten at least once by the 
infamous metaclass/metatype conflict. Here I give a general recipe to
solve the problem, as well as some theory and some examples.

 ::

  #<noconflict.py>

  metadic={}

  def _generatemetaclass(bases,metas,priority):
      trivial=lambda m: sum([issubclass(M,m) for M in metas],m is type)
      # hackish!! m is trivial if it is 'type' or, in the case explicit
      # metaclasses are given, if it is a superclass of at least one of them
      metabs=tuple([mb for mb in map(type,bases) if not trivial(mb)])
      metabases=(metabs+metas, metas+metabs)[priority]
      if metabases in metadic: # already generated metaclass
          return metadic[metabases]
      elif not metabases: # trivial metabase
          meta=type 
      elif len(metabases)==1: # single metabase
          meta=metabases[0]
      else: # multiple metabases
          metaname="_"+''.join([m.__name__ for m in metabases])
          meta=makecls()(metaname,metabases,{})
      return metadic.setdefault(metabases,meta)

  def makecls(*metas,**options):
      """Class factory avoiding metatype conflicts. The invocation syntax is
      makecls(M1,M2,..,priority=1)(name,bases,dic). If the base classes have 
      metaclasses conflicting within themselves or with the given metaclasses, 
      it automatically generates a compatible metaclass and instantiate it. 
      If priority is True, the given metaclasses have priority over the 
      bases' metaclasses"""

      priority=options.get('priority',False) # default, no priority
      return lambda n,b,d: _generatemetaclass(b,metas,priority)(n,b,d)

  #</noconflict.py>

Discussion
---------------------------------------------------------

I think that not too many programmers are familiar with metaclasses and 
metatype conflicts, therefore let me be pedagogical ;) 

The simplest case where a metatype conflict happens is the following.
Consider a class ``A`` with metaclass ``M_A`` and a class ``B`` with
an independent metaclass ``M_B``; suppose we derive ``C`` from ``A`` 
and ``B``. The question is: what is the metaclass of ``C`` ? 
Is it ``M_A`` or ``M_B`` ?

  >>> class M_A(type): 
  ...     pass
  >>> class M_B(type): 
  ...     pass
  >>> class A(object):
  ...     __metaclass__=M_A
  >>> class B(object):
  ...     __metaclass__=M_B
  >>> class C(A,B): 
  ...     pass 
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases

The correct answer (see the book "Putting metaclasses to work" for a 
thought discussion) is ``M_C``, where ``M_C`` is a metaclass that inherits 
from ``M_A`` and ``M_B``, as in the following graph, where instantiation 
is denoted by colon lines:

  ::


             M_A     M_B
              : \   / :
              :  \ /  :
              A  M_C  B
               \  :  /
                \ : /
                  C


However, Python is not that magic, and it does not automatically create 
``M_C``. Instead, it raises a ``TypeError``, warning the programmer of
the possible confusion. The metatype conflict can be avoided 
by assegning the correct metaclass to ``C`` by hand:

  >>> class M_AM_B(M_A,M_B): pass
  ...
  >>> class C(A,B): 
  ...     __metaclass__=M_AM_B
  >>> C,type(C)
  (<class 'C'>, <class 'M_AM_B'>)

In general, a class ``A(B, C, D , ...)`` can be generated without conflicts 
only if ``type(A)`` is a subclass of each of ``type(B), type(C), ...``

It is possible to automatically avoid conflicts, by defining a smart 
class factory that generates the correct metaclass by looking at the 
metaclasses of the base classes. This is done via the ``makecls``
class factory, wich internally invokes the ``_generatemetaclass``
function.

  >>> from noconflict import makecls
  >>> class C(A,B):
  ...     __metaclass__=makecls()
  >>> C 
  <class 'C'>
  >>> type(C) # automatically generated metaclass
  <class 'noconflict._M_AM_B'>

In order to avoid to generate twice the same metaclass,,
they are stored in a dictionary. In particular, when ``_generatemetaclass`` 
is invoked with the same arguments it returns the same metaclass.

  >>> class D(A,B):
  ...     __metaclass__=makecls()
  >>> type(D) 
  <class 'noconflict._M_AM_B'>
  >>> type(C) is type(D)
  True

Another example where ``makecls()`` can solve the conflict is the
following:

  >>> class D(A):
  ...     __metaclass__=M_B
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<string>", line 1, in ?
  TypeError: metaclass conflict: the metaclass of a derived class must be a (non-strict) subclass of the metaclasses of all its bases

Here the problem is that since ``D`` inherits from ``A``, its metaclass must 
inherit from ``M_A`` and cannot be ``M_B``. 

``makecls`` solves the problem by automatically inheriting both from
``M_A`` and ``M_B``:

  >>> class D(A):
  ...     __metaclass__=makecls(M_B)
  >>> type(D)
  <class 'noconflict._M_AM_B'>

In some case, the user may want ``M_B`` to have the priority over ``M_A``.
This is easily done:

  >>> class D(A):
  ...     __metaclass__=makecls(M_B,priority=True)
  >>> type(D)
  <class 'noconflict._M_BM_A'>

``_generatemetaclass`` automatically skips unneeded metaclasses,

  >>> class M0(type): pass
  ...
  >>> class M1(M0): pass
  ...
  >>> class B: __metaclass__=M0
  ...
  >>> class C(B): __metaclass__=makecls(M1)
  ...
  >>> print C,type(C)
  <class 'C'> <class 'M1'>

i.e. in this example where ``M1`` is a subclass of ``M0``, it
returns ``M1`` and does not generate a redundant metaclass ``_M0M1``.

``makecls`` also solves the meta-metaclass conflict, and generic higher
order conflicts:

  >>> class MM1(type): pass
  ...
  >>> class MM2(type): pass
  ...
  >>> class M1(type): __metaclass__=MM1
  ...
  >>> class M2(type): __metaclass__=MM2
  ...
  >>> class A: __metaclass__=M1
  ...
  >>> class B: __metaclass__=M2
  ...
  >>> class C(A,B): __metaclass__=makecls()
  ...
  >>> print C,type(C),type(type(C))
  <class 'C'> <class 'noconflict._M1M2'> <class 'noconflict._MM1MM2'>

I thank David Mertz for help in polishing the original version of the code. 
This version has largerly profited from discussion with Phillip J. Eby.

These examples here have been checked with doctest on Python 2.3b1.
