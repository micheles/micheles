In this talk I will share some hard-learned knowledge
about what works and what doesn't with the sofware stack I have been
using at work for years, i.e. h5py, celery/rabbitmq, PyZMQ, numpy/scipy,
rtree and other libraries. I will discuss the tradeoff we made between
performance, simplicity, and reliability and how did we cope with some
hard library bugs.
