Python in scientific computing: what works and what doesn't
============================================================

There is no want of technologies for doing scientific calculations
in Python. In this talk I will share some hard-learned knowledge
about what works and what doesn't with the libraries we are using at
GEM (the Global Earthquake Model foundation).
I will show how the following libraries fare with respect to our main
concerns of performance, simplicity, reliability and portability

- h5py
- celery/rabbitmq
- PyZMQ
- numpy/scipy
- rtree

and I will talk about several library bugs we found and had to work around.
I will also talk about some libraries that we do not use (such as cython,
numba, dask, pytables, ...) and the reason why we do not use them.
Hopefully this will be useful to people using or planning to use a similar
software stack.
