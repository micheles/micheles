Instructions:

1. Download the file ``decorators.zip`` from my home-page:

   http://www.phyast.pitt.edu/~micheles/python/decorators.zip

2. Unzip it in a directory, for instance:

   ``unzip decorators -d decorators``

3. Test that everything works:

  ``cd decorators; python doct.py decorators.txt``

4. Add the decorators directory to your Python path or copy the files 
   decorators.py, noconflict.py, debugger.py into your Python distribution.

5. It is always a good idea to give a look to the README.txt file.

Notice: Python 2.3 is required. I have tested that it works (at least for
me) both under Red Hat 7.3 and under Windows 98SE.
