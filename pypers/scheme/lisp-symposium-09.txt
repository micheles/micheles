Title: Everything you always wanted to know about the R6RS module
system, or how to port libraries between different R6RS implementations.

Author:  Michele Simionato

Abstract: The R6RS module systems is quite new and it is the result of
various compromises. As a consequence, it has some rough edges and
writing portable code - specially for macro writers - is not
trivial.  This talk tries to explain how the module system works and
how I was able to port a library involving nontrivial macros amongst
multiple R6RS implementations, by discovering all kind of bugs and
gotchas in the process.
