In the previous post I have talked only about the PyPy project.
But there was very interesting things even for people living in
the real world. So, let's talk about them.
       
ACCU Conference (PyUK) 2005: a personal view (part 3)
=======================================================

Installation & Deployment of Python applications
------------------------------------------------------

I should really thank Andy Robinson for the great job he
did as chairman and organizer of the Python track, as well
for the choice of the talks. He really covered everything
from the most abstract and suble matters to the most concrete
and real life practical things. So we had a couple of talks
on installing and deploying Python applications.

I really liked the one by Nathan Yergler, presenting his work 
on Creatives Common applications. His talk was 0% marketing and
100% sound advice and very concrete help on what works and what 
does not work if you are trying to distribute a multiplatform
application based on wxPython.

In the same vein, Andy Robinson gave a talk on the challenges
Reportlab faced with the installation and maintenance of their
toolkit on many platforms. The message I got is that distutils is 
not enough, and that at the end they had to develop your own 
installation software.

This is sad, but I recognized the truth in what Nathan and
Yergler were saying: installation and deployement are
higly non-trivial and time-consuming activities which
are now more complex than needed. Andy said he took
inspiration from what Ant did in the Java world, when
writing his own installation tools and he made a made
strong advocacy for Ant, saying that we should have something like that 
in standard library. I do not know Ant personally, but I have
use distutils recently and I must say that whereas is quite
at some things, it is not that easy to build on top of it.
In practice, it is just faster to write a custom tool than
to use distutils.

 
Comparison of Graphics Toolkits
-------------------------------------------------

We got a really nice demonstration about Qt Designer by 
John Pinner, supplemented by a lightening talk by Trolltech
(which must have the youngest and prettiest girl-engineers
out there). I am not really capable of using such tools
(I would probably be more at home with an s-expression 
representation of the widgets) but still I was pretty
impressed by the easy of use. Plus, after a few click,
you get an impressively clean piece of Python code
with all the classes and the objects corresponding
to the pictures you just drawn.

There was also a comparable presentation by Alex Tweedly about
PythonCard, but I missed it since I attended a Agile talk by
an Italian friend I met there.

Web Frameworks
-------------------------------------------------

There was a talk about Zope3 which I was very interested in,
and a lightening talk about CherryPy by Ron Collins.
Plus Andy Robinsons discussing the Reportlab hand-made
Web framework, and the problems they got testing it.

This is a subject I was very interested to hear about,
since I have been experimenting with the subject. Unfortunately,
it looks like everybody is trying to solve the issue in
similar ways (essentially building custom tools on top of urllib).
I discovered various simple applications to do Web scripting
but nothing standard or widely used. This is certainly an area
where the standard library could be extended.
