Automatic testing proved extremely effective in
helping code design, improving code reliability, 
and enabling code refactoring. 
Therefore, most modern languages provide a
standard testing framework.
Python is no exception and provide a powerful
Smalltalk/Java-inspired unittest framework. 
However, Python also provides a *second*, less known 
but arguably *better*, testing framework called doctest.. 
In this talk I will show to the audience the wonders of
doctest, explaining why it is so cool and deserving attention.
