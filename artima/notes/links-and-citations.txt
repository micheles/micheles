Sometimes Python is accused of having too many web frameworks. And it’
s true, there are a lot. That said, I think writing a framework is a
useful exercise. It doesn’t let you skip over too much without
understanding it. It removes the magic. So even if you go on to use
another existing framework (which I’d probably advise you do), you’
ll be able to understand it better if you’ve written something like
it on your own. -- Ian Bicking http://pythonpaste.org/webob/do-it-yourself.html
