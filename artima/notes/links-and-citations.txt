Sometimes Python is accused of having too many web frameworks. And it’
s true, there are a lot. That said, I think writing a framework is a
useful exercise. It doesn’t let you skip over too much without
understanding it. It removes the magic. So even if you go on to use
another existing framework (which I’d probably advise you do), you’
ll be able to understand it better if you’ve written something like
it on your own. -- Ian Bicking http://pythonpaste.org/webob/do-it-yourself.html


 Scheme had a dual
defined purpose as an implementation experimental platform and as a
teaching language ... the fact that it can actually be used
productively is, in some sense, incidental. -- George Neuner on c.l.s.



I think one good outcome of R6RS is that library writers form a
bridge between implementors who would not be collaborating otherwise -- Aziz

Enterprise Scale
------------------ 

In talking with a sysadmin about installs, it occurred to me what the working definition of Enterprise Scale is

    The install is not "next-next-done" wizard


Desktop and "departmental" applications have easy-to-use installers with few options and simple configurations.

Enterprise applications do not have installers and have configurations so complex and terrifying that it takes numerous specialists (Sysadmins, DBA's, programmers, managers, business analysts and users) to install and configure the application.

That's how we know that a LAMP-based application stack involving Python can't be enterprise-ready. Python and MySQL install with "next-next-done" wizards. The application suite installs with a few dozen easy_install steps followed by a database build script.

Anything that simple can't scale. *S.Lott*
