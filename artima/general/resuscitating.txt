Resuscitating a seven year old laptop
---------------------------------------------

Recently, I have spent a few days trying to recover a very old Compaq 
laptop, which I have been neglecting for years - actually was using
it by now she has her `new Eeepc`_

The laptop was in a pretty bad shape:

- the builtin Ethernet interface does not work, as an aftermath of a 
  lightning storm of 4 years ago;
- the builtin CD Writer/DVD Reader stopped working 5 years ago;
- the external DVD Writer I bought 3 years go does not work either;
- the BIOS is unable to boot from the two USB ports which, BTW,
  only support the prehistoric USB 1.1 protocol.

You understand that it was difficult to install some serious operating
system on it, to replace Windows XP. I did not want to buy another external
DVD Writer, since nowadays I have no need for it: I use an external USB
disks for my backups, it is cheeper than buying DVDs.
Luckily, by googling on the net, I have discovered the Smart Boot Manager
project: if you have a system which is unable to boot from an USB pen
or and USB drive, but has a floppy reader, you can boot from the smart
boot floppy and dispatch to the real boot media to complete the
booting process. So I made a smart boot floppy and I was able to install
Ubuntu 8.10 on my laptop from a pen drive.
Moreover, a few weeks ago I did buy a wireless USB kit, since it was
really chip (something like 14 Euros) and I used that to replace
the wired connection. The wireless card was recognized out of the box
by Ubuntu, without need of any external driver, whereas on XP I had
to download the custom drivers from the producer site.
