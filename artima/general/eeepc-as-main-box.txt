So far I have been using `my wife's EeePC`_  as my main platform for
four or five days. I have installed on it a lot of software I use for
writing my articles, including

- emacs
- latex
- python2.5
- python2.6
- python3.0
- numpy & matplotlib
- sphinx
- sqlite
- postgresql
- PLT scheme
- Chicken scheme
- Ikarus Scheme
- Larceny Scheme
- Ypsilon Scheme

and many any other things. I have compiled from source most stuff,
without any issue.

Right now I am preparing my talk for the `Italian PyCon`_, when I 
want to demonstrate, running live from the EeePC, matplotlib and
sphinx.

What can I say? The EeePC is not fast as the MacBook, but perfectly
usable anyway, and everything works. I did try to use `my old Compaq`_
laptop first, but I could not use Ikarus on it, because its Athlon process
was too old and had no support for the SSE3 instructions required by
Ikarus.  The EeePC instead works just fine and it actually much faster
than the old laptop (FWIW, compiling Larceny took less than half the
time) which costed something like 1500 Euros. 

Now I am thinking if it makes sense for me to buy another "serious"
laptop and to spend something like 800 Euros or if I can just buy
another netbook for 300 Euros and be done with it.

The netbooks have really revolutioned the market and they are certainly
not good only for surfing the Internet.
