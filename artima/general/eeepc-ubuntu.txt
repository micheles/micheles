The other day my wife told me that she was unhappy with her EeePC, the one
we got as a wedding present (the story was told in a `previous post`_).
She was experiencing random freezing while surfing the net. 
I thought of an issue with some Firefox plugin but I could not find
anything wrong. So I took the occasion and I said, "well, why not to try
some other Linux distribution than the default (Xandros) since I have
heard that most distributions features a good support for the EeePC?".

So I did. I chose Ubuntu since it is the distribution `I use on my MacBook`_.
I have also tried the Eeebuntu_ distribution which is expressly written
for the EeePC, but I came back to basic Ubuntu since I prefer the
standard desktop, both form an aesthetic point of view and because of
familiarity and usability.

The installation went smoothly, just following the instructions
at array.org_, an apt-get repository where you can find 
Adam McDaniel's kernel for the EeePC. Actually, since I did not want
to erase the Xandros distribution I did some experiment first, by
installing the new OS on a separate drive. I did discover that
installing on a USB pen drive is perfectly possible, but the experience is
painful: the installation takes nearly two hours, and then the machine is
very slow. On the other hand, installing on an external hard disk 
takes less than half an hour and then the machine is very snappy.
It looks like disk speed is an extremely important factor when
it comes to the responsiveness of the EeePC: the processor 
is not the bottleneck, the disks are. 

After those experiments I installed
on the internal disks - which are solid state devices - and I have got
performances comparable to using an external hard disk. I have also
discovered that the smaller disk (my EeePC has two internal disk, a 4GB
one and a 16GB one) is much faster than the bigger one.
I formatted the disks so that the "/" partition was on the small disk
and the "/usr" partition was on the big disk.

As I said everything went fine. Notice that you absolutely wants to install
the eee-control utility (``apt-get install eee-control``) which allows
you to control the performance of the processor and to enable/disable
the wifi, the bluetooth, the webcam and the card reader.

I had two big positive surprises:

1. With Ubuntu and Adam's kernel the machine is extremely more
   responsive than with the default Xandros distribution.  This was
   completely unexpected. Of course the advantage of Ubuntus versus
   Xandros is that you have (much) more updated and bigger
   repositories of packages, but I did not expect to see a substantial
   difference in responsivity.  There is, instead: opening the video
   player, of Firefox, or any other application is much faster.
   Moreover the default Ubuntu video player is *much* faster than the 
   Xandros default player.

2. The graphics card of the Eeepc is pretty powerful and/or particularly
   well supported: in particular Compiz works out of the box and I could
   enable the Desktop Cube effect which I could not get to work on my
   MacBook. I could not see any
   difference in responsivity with respect to my desktop computer,
   which has 4 GB or RAM and a nvidia graphics card.
   I have also tried to connect the EeePC to an external monitor 
   and to my TV (which features a 1360x768 resolution): everything
   works perfectly, including the Cube effect. We saw
   `Once Upon a Time in America`_ just yesterday night on the 42 inches
   display, and the vision was perfectly fluid and clear.

With Ubuntu the EeePC feels like a real computer. I have even installed
Postgres on it and I think one could use it for development, not just for
surfing the net. Now that there are models with bigger displays I think
my next laptop will be a netbook.
