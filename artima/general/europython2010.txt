Just a short note to remind my readers that this year I will be at
the `EuroPython conference`_ in Birmingham, 19th to 22nd July 2010.

I have been missing from EuroPython for a few years, but this year
the schedule_ looks fantastic. Lots of first class Pythonistas and
Guido van Rossum will come too! 

I will give a talk titled `Introduction to Functional Programming`_
which had a lot of success at the recent `Italian PyCon`_. It looks
like there is a number of people interested in functional programming
these days.

Next year EuroPython will be held in Florence, Italy (and I am in the
organizing committee, so I know what I am talking about ;). If for any
reason you cannot come to Birmingham, consider a vacation in the
beautiful Florence next year!
