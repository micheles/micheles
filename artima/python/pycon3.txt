`PyConTre Italy`_ is the major conference with focus on Python in Italy.
Last year we had more than 300 participants and this year we expect
to have much more due to the partecipation of Guido van Rossum, the
creator and `Benevolent Dictator For Life`_ of Python.

The conference will start with a keynote by Guido, held 
in Palazzo Vecchio (Florence) on May, the 8th 2009, and will
continue the next two days with a few dozen talks.

In the past all the talks have been of very high profile
and I am confident we will reach an even higher level this
year. We expect many well known Pythonistas to come, including
Alex Martelli and Raymond Hettinger.

I am in the `organizing committee`_ , even if I must confess I am a
very lazy organizer with respect to the ones who
live in Florence and are actually doing the hard work 
(I mean Giovanni Baio and all the Develer_ crew, thank you guys!).

Being an Italian conference, most talks are in Italian but we have
a translation service for our foreigner guests, so that you can follow
the conference even if you do not know Italian. Of course, you don't
need to know anything to enjoy the city and the world famous Fiorentina_ ;)

The `Call For Papers`_ will open in February the 9th: if you plan to
partecipate and you are interested in presenting a paper
you can send an email to the info@pycon.it or even to any
member of the `organizing committee`_ .

The last year we had a number of generous sponsors (including Skype_,
the `Python Software Foundation`_ and many others): thanks to them,
PyConDue was one of the cheapest conference ever, and I expect the
same will be true this year too. If you are interested in sponsoring
the event, you should read the `sponsor page`_ and write to
sponsor@pycon.it .

Finally, there is a `newsletter/google group`_ of the Italian Python
Association, which main purpose is to help people with questions about
the conference. Now you have no excuses not to come. See you in Florence! ;-)
