I am an atypical programmer, since I spent most of my career doing
science, not programming. When I first learned about Object Oriented
Programming, a little bit more than seven years ago, I compared it
with my experience in Mathematics and Physics. I was puzzled. In
Mathematics you have objects (consider for instance the elements of a
`Lie group`_) but the objects themselves are not important: the
important entities are the relations about the objects, their
properties.  When I write ``a + b`` in a mathematical expression I am
not really interested in the objects: ``a`` and ``b`` may be numbers,
or matrices, or functions, or oven operators in a Hilbert space if I
am doing Quantum Mechanics: in any case, the important thing is the
addition operation. The ``+`` means that I am performing a commutative
operation and therefore that the objects I am using are part of a
commutative group and a set of well know properties are valid for
them. Translated into programming jargon, that idea means exactly that
the important things are the interfaces, i.e.  the set of
operations/methods which are available to the objects, not the objects
themselves. Actually, the details about what the objects really are
can be disregarded as implementation artifacts and I can write generic
code which works for all objects satisfying a known interface, just as
in Mathematics I can write a single proof valid for the entire class
of entities satisfying a given set of properties.

This was my *forma mentis* when I begun studying object orientation. I
was used to consider functions as the primary entities, and objects as
inert material on top of which functions operate. Actually, it seemed
backwards to me to attach functions to (classes of) objects.  In
traditional (Smalltalk-inspired) OOP instead this is exactly what
happens.  One focuses on objects: one writes ``window.create()``, not
``create(window)``. One is induced to put the focus on the window
which owns the ``.create`` method and not on the general operation of
creation which is meaningful for all kinds of objects.  Anyway, I kept
studying and at the end I become acquainted with the OOP approach: I
was no more disturbed by ``window.create()`` vs ``create(window)``.
It is ironic that a year later I discovered Lisp and its object system
(CLOS_) where you indeed write ``create(window)``. It is understable
that I immediately became a supporter of generic functions: I decided
that I was right the first time after all ;) It is also clear why I am
a supporter of functional programming.  Nowadays, after years of
experience writing an maintaining large code bases, I am even more
convinced the really important things are not the objects (or classes)
but the interfaces.

During my first six months of OOP programming I also
had issues with another concept: *inheritance*. I remember that when I saw
classes for the first time I said "look ma, objects are just the same as Pascal
records and methods are just functions taking a record as first
argument, they are not difficult at all!". It turns out I was
wrong. Classes are very much different than Pascal records, the reason
being *inheritance*. Inheritance makes classes quite nontrivial, and I
had to write a paper on inheritance to understand its gory details (my
first paper about programming, the infamous MRO_ paper). At that point
however I only understood the tecnical details; but a year later I was
hired as a programmer, I started working with Zope and then I
understood what inheritance really was in the real word. From that
time I started looking for alternative solutions to
inheritance. I remember that once (something like 4 or 5 years ago) I
implemented a toy object system in Scheme without inheritance, to see
how it was like to program without it. From that experiment I
concluded that one cannot really avoid single inheritance (I mean, you
can, but then you have to implement some workaround which is more or
less equivalent to it) whereas instead you can easily throw multiple
inheritance out of the window. A couple of years ago
I also became interested in the language SML_ which I really liked for
various reasons, the most important being the lack on inheritance
and the presence of *interfaces*.

It is at that moment that I decided to start a public campaign against
inheritance and pro interfaces. Interfaces are the really important
idea, not inheritance, but unfortunately many languages conflate the
two concepts and make things confusing. Inheritance is a (often wrong) way
of ensuring interface compliance, in the sense that a subclass
satifies the same interface of its superclass, but in general two
objects can have the same interface without having a common base
class. After studying SML I became really convinced that there should
be a formal way to specify that property in the language.  I also
decided to write a set of articles about the dangers of inheritance: I
published on Artima four papers about mixins (1_, 2_, 3_ and 4_), a
paper about `generic functions`_ and a paper about traits_ for people
still emotionally attached to the Smalltalk OOP model and not wanting
to switch to the CLOS model. I also planned to write a paper about
interfaces, to explain how things should be done, but I never wrote
it. The main reason is lack of time, since I was busy with `The
Adventures of a Pythonista in Schemeland`_ and other things; there is
also a secondary reason; I needed a language with interfaces done
right to explain what I had in mind, and I was reluctant to use SML as
that language. I mean, SML is very nice and it does interfaces really
well, but it is definitively not a language for the large
public. Python has interfaces (starting from Python 2.6) which are
acceptable but not really what I had in mind.

Now finally there is Go_. Go is a new language which was released this
week by Google; it was designed by old-timers of the caliber of Rob
Pike and Ken Thompson, so I decided to take it very seriously and to
have a look at it.  It turns out that Go `lacks inheritance`_ and it
has exactly `the kind of interfaces I had in mind`_ for all this
time. I do not need to write my paper about interfaces vs inheritance
anymore: just look at `Go documentation`_!  I am still playing with Go
at the moment.  As every language it has a few good things and a few
bad things.  I particularly like two blog posts by Mark Chu-Carroll
(this_ and that_). Of course everybody is writing about Go nowadays
and you can find tons of comments about the language on the net. There
is also an extremely activew newsgroup_. Here I just wanted to point
out the design choices about interfaces and inheritance.  Such ideas
are not new and it is a shame that no popular language has followed
such particular route in the design space. I hope Go will become
popular; if not, I hope such ideas will finally enter in a popular
language, we are already 10 or 20 years too late :-(
