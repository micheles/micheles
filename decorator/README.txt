Decorator module
---------------------------

Dependencies:

The decorator module requires Python 2.4.

Installation:

Copy the file decorator.py somewhere in your Python path.

Testing:

Run

$ python documentation.py

This should work perfectly with Python 2.7 and Python 2.6 and give a few
expected errors with Python 2.5 and 2.4 (some inner details such as the
introduction of the ArgSpec namedtuple and Thread.__repr__ changed).
